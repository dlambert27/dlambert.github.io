                This is a theoretical alien world. For my alien world, I wanted
                to go for a hidden base in the mountains sort of vibe. The
                picture focuses on a rope bridge leading into the mountains and
                the base. The backdrop is supposed to be violent, chaotic winds
                with the ghostly remains of life looming in the background.

                This is a character design that I made called Freeg. Freeg is a
                simple creature, merely just trying to survive day to day and
                trying to get enough food for the day. For this character
                design, I originally wanted to go for a more "Sock Puppet" style
                of creature (Beady eyes, simple features, round mouth). In the
                end, I decided on turning this character into a plant-like
                creature in a pot. I thought it would look funnier than just a
                head poking out of the ground. For this design, I wanted to
                practice with general creature design. My style tends to lean
                more towards horrific, stylized art, so I wanted to transfer
                that into a more simplistic, cuter design.

              This is a character design based on Yggdrasil, the World Tree
              from Norse Mythology. The animal parts are inspired by the
              various animals that live on Yggdrasil. For this character
              design, I wanted to challenge myself by making a humanoid
              creature.

              Impeode is a terrestrial planet that was once a very similar planet to Earth. It once hosted a large variety of life, including a highly-intelligent, ground-dwelling species that dominated the planet. However, due to numerous meteor showers, it has transformed into what it is today.

              Meteoruptera is a omnivorous species of insect that is in the universe of Meteorum. They are characterized by their large wings, colorful wing tassels, and their probiscis-like beak. They can grow up to a foot in length, however Escorts can grow tens of times larger, around 20 - 30 feet in length. The males are a deep red, while the females are a muted brown. Their legs are either black or yellow, with claws ranging from a bright yellow to a light green. Their wings' colors are synonymous with what nest their affiliated with. Their wings also have long wing tassels that look like the tail of a comet.
