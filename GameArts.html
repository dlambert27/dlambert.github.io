                This is the game intro for a game I worked on called Wildfire
                Rescue. In the game, you play as a crew of firefighters in a
                helicopter, saving animals from the deadly wildfire. You collect
                the animals into the helicopter, and transport them to a safety
                zone. For the game, I created the game intro, the logo, as well
                as the 3d models for the animals and helicopter.

                This is a game trailer for a game I made called Martian
                Malfunction. In the game, you are tasked with finding lost
                pieces of your ship in order to escape this planet, as well as
                finding anything valuable you can trade in for Credits once you
                are ready to leave. For the game, I wanted to go for a Wild West
                theme for the level. I thought that, along with the alien parts
                strewned throughout the level, would contrast well.

                This is a board game called Convergence. This game was completed
                as part of a team. I did the card assets, character designs,
                board design, and the Converegence logo. For this assignment, we
                were tasked with creating our final game for the class. For the
                characters, they were originally the idea of one of my other
                group members. Character descriptions are below.

                The Iron Legionnaire is a heroic, paladin type. For the design,
                I wanted to emulate that by giving him a traditional knight's
                helmet. I also wanted to include inspiration from games such as
                "Skyrim".

                The Lost Prince is a tragic, royal prince. For the design, I
                wanted to emulate that by giving him more pointed edges like a
                crown, along with inspiration from games such as "Dark Souls".

                The Shadowed Acolyte is a wise, but shady individual. For the
                design, I wanted to emulate that by giving him a hooded cloak
                with a beaked mask called a Bautta. These masks were
                traditionally used by plague doctors, so I thought it would fit.

            <div class="description">
              <h5>
                The Vigilant Squire is an upbeat, naive Squire. For the design,
                I wanted to emulate that by giving him a more round design to
                show his kindness (as round as helmets can be). I also wanted to
                include medieval European style parts to the helmet, such as the
                mouthguard.
