              <h5>This is a game trailer for a game I made called Martian Malfunction. In the game, you are tasked with finding lost pieces of your ship in order to escape this planet, as well as finding anything valuable you can trade in for Credits once you are ready to leave. For the game, I wanted to go for a Wild West theme for the level. I thought that, along with the alien parts strewned throughout the level, would contrast well. </h5>

                  <h6 style="font-size: 13px;">This is a character design that I made called Freeg. Freeg is a simple creature, merely just trying to survive day to day and trying to get enough food for the day. For this character design, I originally wanted to go for a more "Sock Puppet" style of creature (Beady eyes, simple features, round mouth). In the end, I decided on turning this character into a plant-like creature in a pot. I thought it would look funnier than just a head poking out of the ground. For this design, I wanted to practice with general creature design. My style tends to lean more towards horrific, stylized art, so I wanted to transfer that into a more simplistic, cuter design.</h6>
